  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi! I’m Josh, I’m a highschool senior and future UTSA roadrunner. While my main passion is computer science and teaching, art has always been important to me, when I am doing art, I feel more in touch with my creativity which is helpful in all areas of my life. For the last 2 years of my highschool career, I have tried to incorporate art into my life in all aspects, my junior year I took art 1 and this year im taking art 2 honors. Outside of those classes I devote my time to playing guitar, piano, and making songs.</p>

    <h2>My Growth</h2>
    <p>This year, I really tried getting out of my comfort zone with different media that I am not familiar with, over the year I have become more confident using acrylic paint and colored pencil which were my greatest weaknesses at a time. I also tried to take more risks with my art, experimenting with creative ideas and incorporating texture and spontenaity into my art.</p>
